# Training: Distributed Services with Go

According to the book by Traevis Jeffery, this repository implements the code examples from the book with slight modifications.

For example:

- Instead of using a 3rd party library for mmap, I used the `syscall` standard library.
- Some error handling is done differently.

This training is a work in progress and will be updated as I progress through the book.

I also take a step back to avoid bad practices.

For now, the book seems quite good.
